# Proposal for the Curve DAO Grants Council

## Objective
Use the LLamas job marketplace to source and hire an experienced dev to found a data-driven research and marketing guild that tells easy-to-digest onchain stories about the Curve ecosystem. 

## Need

Some of the most interesting events in all of crypto happen on Curve. Yet, understanding these onchain moments can feel unapproachable to many — namely, newer market participants. 

Clearly communicating the nuances and daily happenings of the Curve ecosystem, in a compelling way, showcases its vibrancy and will attract new participants and contributors. 

Example: the data-first graphs and content supporting the crvUSD launch have made an incredibly complex system easier to understand and use.

## Proposers

Hawthorne and Panda, co-founders of the LLamas ([notion.so/the-llamas](https://www.notion.so/the-llamas/0e3fa69ef54245dea74e1aa17fb86497?v=147051a45bbd41b796adedd261826c2e)), envision building a permissionless talentpool of contributors and founders within the Curve ecosystem. 

We are pursuing our first grant from the Curve DAO Grants Council to build this subdao. 

## Progress

So far, the LLamas job marketplace has completed work for Reserve and a series of collaborations between zkEVM Polygon and Aave, Maker (Spark), and CoW. 

We have used our platform to locate and engage driven, talented devs across multiple skillsets.

Now, the LLamas is looking to engage and direct its talent toward long-term contributions to Curve via creating a sustainable subdao.  

## Planning

1. Use LLamas job marketplace to engage a dev to found the guild.
2. LLamas will present candidates to Fiddy for approval on skillset and cultural fit. 
3. Begin producing as much data-driven writing and visual content as possible in 6 months—— including how-to content to better navigate the ecosystem, in collaboration with existing efforts.
4. Leverage the different skill sets of driven LLamas job market participants to tell compelling data-stories about Curve, across multiple mediums.
5. Place SEO-optimized content on venues that will get the most traction to onboard and attract new users. 

## Documentation Management
The content and visual assets will be hosted on the Jupyter notebook or Notion, open to public contributions and updates. 

## Budget
10,000 USD per month for 6 months, split 75/25 between funding the guild's lead dev and the guild itself. Open to review, reworking and extension based on progress at the end of the 6 month period.
