# Proposal for the Curve DAO Grants Council

## Objective
Use the LLamas jobs Marketplace to hire an experienced dev to found a data-driven research and marketing guild that tells easy-to-digest onchain stories about the Curve ecosystem. 

## Need

Some of the most interesting events in all of crypto happen on Curve. Yet, understanding and using those data-stories can feel unapproachable to many — and namely newer — market participants. 

Clearly communicating the nuances and daily events of the Curve ecosystem in a compelling way showcases its vibrancy and will attract new participants and contributors. 

Example: the data-first graphs and content supporting the crvUSD launch have made an incredibly complex system easier to understand, use and champion.

## Proposers

Hawthorne and Panda, co-founders of the LLamas ([notion.so/the-llamas](https://www.notion.so/the-llamas/0e3fa69ef54245dea74e1aa17fb86497?v=147051a45bbd41b796adedd261826c2e)), envision building a permissionless talentpool of contributors and founders within the Curve ecosystem. 

We are pursuing our first grant from the Curve DAO Grants Council. 

## Progress

So far, the job marketplace has completed work for Reserve and a series of collaborations between zkEVM Polygon and Aave, Maker (Spark), and CoW. 

We have located and enabled driven, talented devs across multiple skillsets within our community.  

Now, the project is looking to engage and direct its talent toward long-term contributions to Curve.  

## Planning

1. Use LLamas job marketplace to engage a Dev to found the guild
2. Begin producing as much data-driven writing and visual content as possible in 6 months—— including how-to content to better navigate the ecosystem. 
3. Leverage the different skill sets of driven LLamas jobs market participants to tell compelling data-stories about Curve
4. Place content in places that will get the most traction to onboard and attract new users. 

## Documentation Management
The content and visual assetes will be hosted on the Jupyter notebook, open to public contributions and updates. 

## Budget
10,000 USD per month for 6 months, split 75/25 between funding the guild lead and the guild itself. Open to review, reworking and extension based on progress at the end of the 6 month period.
